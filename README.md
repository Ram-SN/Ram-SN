I am a Data Scientist who is passionate about making use of data to its utmost potential by employing various techniques and strategies. Some technologies I enjoy working on are Python, Pyspark, MySql and Tableau. ðŸŒ± I love learning new things and keeping in touch with the foundations, so theres a very high chance I'm going through something right now. I recently created an Interactive Map/POC for US-Ignite that lets small-businesses in Portland, Oregon identify the best locations for their industry based on socio-economic factors, pedestrian and vehicular count information. 

Some interesting Projects I've worked on:

Fall 2019
1. Predicting Prices of Houses in NYC based on their proximity to Transportation and Parks
2. Analyzing CitiBike Ridership in Jersey City to suggest city officials for appropriate bike park stations and cycle lanes.
3. Understanding the Affect of a Built Environment using Geospatial Clustering Techniques.

Spring 2020
1. Building a recommender system using with ALS for the Goodreads Dataset
2. Geospatial Matching and Indexing NYC Parking tickets without Lat and Long Information
3. Predicting Pests in NYC houses using 311 call data, population information and building characteristics

Summer 2020
1. Smart Monitor for Accelerating Regional Transformation (SMART)
2. Analyzing New York City Traffic
