I am a Data Scientist who is passionate about making use of data to its utmost potential by employing various techniques and strategies. Some technologies I enjoy working on are Python, Pyspark, MySql and Tableau. ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always updating myself on topics to make sure I've always got the foundation down. I recently created an Interactive Map/POC for US-Ignite that lets small-businesses in Portland, Oregon identify the best locations for their industry based on socio-economic factors, pedestrian and vehicular count information.
